Hold files and folders for Module 12 challenge

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. 
You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to 
help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
Part 2: Update the Database
Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

Part 1 and Part 2 of this challenge are in the NoSQL_setup_final.ipynb file                      

Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the code must be run consecutively to work properly, as changes made to data types in parts 1&2 affect query code in part 3                       

Part 3 of this challenge is in the NoSQL_analysis_final.ipynb file


The resources file (establishments.json) was too large to upload to the repository and had to be zipped.           
It must be downloaded and unzipped to use it
